# dual-name-organiser
> Organises files into folders with the name scheme "&lt;file category> &lt;number>". Originally made for my Photos folder.

For example, a file named "Photo 12" would be sorted into the folder "Photo" and have the filename "12".

## Usage
With python3 and default libraries:
```batch
python organise.py "<path to the folder that you want to organise>"
```
